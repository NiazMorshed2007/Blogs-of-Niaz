In Next.js, deciding whether to use Server Components or Client Components can have a significant impact on your application's performance and functionality. In this blog post, we will explore the use cases for each component type and guide when to choose Server Components or Client Components.

### Understanding Server Components and Client Components

Server Components are the default choice in Next.js. They execute on the server, allowing you to fetch data, access backend resources directly, and keep sensitive information like access tokens and API keys secure. Here is a blog post I wrote on 👉 [Server Components](https://niazmorshed.hashnode.dev/exploring-the-power-of-server-components-in-nextjs)

On the other hand, Client Components are executed on the client-side, providing interactivity and leveraging browser-only APIs. They are useful for adding event listeners, managing state with hooks like useState() and useReducer().

### Choosing Between Server and Client Components

To simplify the decision-making process, let's consider the different use cases for Server Components and Client Components:

| Use case | Server Components | Client Components |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fetch data. | ✅ | ❌ |
| Access backend resources (directly) | ✅ | ❌ |
| Keep sensitive information on the server (access tokens, API keys, etc) | ✅ | ❌ |
| Keep large dependencies on the server / Reduce client-side JavaScript | ✅ | ❌ |
| Add interactivity and event listeners (`onClick()`, `onChange()`, etc) | ❌ | ✅ |
| Use State and Lifecycle Effects (`useState()`, `useReducer()`, `useEffect()`, etc) | ❌ | ✅ |
| Use browser-only APIs | ❌ | ✅ |
| Use custom hooks that depend on state, effects, or browser-only APIs | ❌ | ✅ |
| Use React Class Components | ❌ | ✅ |

Note: The decision between Server Components and Client Components ultimately depends on the specific requirements of your application and the nature of the task at hand. Consider the strengths and limitations of each component type when making your architectural choices.
