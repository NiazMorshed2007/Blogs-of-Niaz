Introducing **Popwola 1.1.0**! Now with the all-new responsive editor feature, creating device-responsive popups has never been easier.

With Popwola 1.1.0, you have three views at your fingertips: desktop (the default), tablet, and mobile. Switch effortlessly between these views in the editor to customize your popups for different screen sizes. Say goodbye to the hassle of compatibility issues‚ÄîPopwola now empowers you with the flexibility to create stunning, responsive popups without any complications. üôå

## Development Phases

1. ### Planning
    
    Yes, every successful project begins with careful planning. Recognizing the importance of laying a strong foundation, I dedicated long hours to meticulous planning. This involved selecting the key features, anticipating potential challenges, outlining the UI skeleton, mapping out the user journey, and conceptualizing the overall app design. To capture this pivotal moment, here's a picture that showcases my dedicated effort to planning...
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1686307861452/e740bfc9-1028-44a4-8f4e-439976d33d4c.jpeg align="center")
    
    After planning, it turns out that a lot of features could be implemented including conversion rate tracking, analytics, lead collection and many more. But I focused on some selected features for this release. The selected features are already mentioned on top.
    
2. ### Designing
    
    The design phase is a crucial stage in the development process, where the visual aesthetics and user experience of the project come to life. Here's an overview of the key steps involved in the design phase:
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1686317974330/8192dd1a-a031-41f7-9695-f6e9abf9c0b1.png align="center")
    
    i) Gathering Requirements:  
    After carefully analyzing the project requirements, I identified the key pages that needed design attention. These pages include:
    
    * A dashboard page for displaying instructions and important information.
        
    * A profile page for users to customize their profiles.
        
    * A campaigns page where all available campaigns will be listed.
        
    * A campaign creation page for users to create new campaigns.
        
    * An editor page for designing popups.
        
    * A preview page for users to preview their campaigns.
        
    * A library page for listing all available campaigns.
        
    
    ii) Research and Inspiration:  
    To ensure a fresh and innovative design approach, I conducted thorough research and drew inspiration from various sources. Platforms like Dribbble and other design communities provided valuable insights and ideas. By immersing myself in design inspirations, I gained a clearer vision of the desired aesthetics and user experience.
    
3. ### Coding the App
    
    During the coding phase, it was mixed feelings of cry and joy. I brought the visual designs to life by implementing the functionalities of Popwola. Leveraging technologies like Next.js 13, [Appwrite](https://appwrite.io) and TypeScript, I created reusable UI components and integrated features such as the no-code editor, timeline management, and preview option. Version control tools facilitated collaboration and maintained code integrity throughout the development process. The coding phase transformed the design into a fully functional app, ready to empower users with a seamless no-code popup building experience.
    

## Tech stack used

Popwola is built on top of hot technologies including:

1. [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/): A popular React framework for building fast and scalable applications.
    
2. [Appwrite](https://appwrite.io/): An open-source backend server that simplifies the development process.
    
3. [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/): A bunch of components kit for creating stunning UI.
    
4. Redux: For state management
    
5. [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): A statically typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code maintainability and developer productivity.
    
6. [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/): A utility-first CSS framework that enables rapid UI development with pre-built components and customizable styling.
    

## Features of appwrite used

1. Authentication: üîí
    
    I utilized Appwrite's incredibly user-friendly authentication system to add authentication to my app. I thoroughly enjoyed working with it!
    
2. Appwrite Database: üìÉ
    
    I leveraged the database to store data for my app. The document-based permission feature was particularly impressive and greatly enhanced data security.
    
3. Appwrite Storage: üè¨
    
    I integrated Appwrite's storage functionality to store popup images uploaded by users. This feature provided a seamless experience for managing and retrieving user-generated content.
    

## Challenges I faced building it

1. Getting Familiar with Appwrite:
    
    When I first started using Appwrite, it took me some time to grasp its features and become comfortable with its functionalities. However, once I gained a better understanding, working with it became an enjoyable experience.
    
2. Implementing the moveable feature:
    
    I was quite frustrated to think of how I could build such an interface for draggable, resizable and moveable flexibility of elements. But the [react-moveable](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-moveable?activeTab=readme) library saved my life!
    
3. Setting Up Redux with the Editor:
    
    Integrating Redux with the editor posed a challenge. It required some effort to configure and establish the necessary connections between the two. However, once everything was properly set up, it greatly enhanced the functionality and user experience of the project.
    
4. Creating the `script-min.js` File for Seamless Popup Handling
    
    To ensure smooth and seamless handling of popups, I had to create the script-min.js file. This involved carefully designing the script to handle popups in a way that provided a seamless and user-friendly interaction. Although it required some extra work, the end result greatly improved the overall usability of the project.

## Scope of new features üìà

üöÄ Popwola is here to revolutionize popup creation with ease! But wait, there's so much more to explore! After conducting market research, I've uncovered some exciting features that can transform Popwola into a globally embraced gem. Let's dive in and discover the possibilities! üíé

1. Lead generation üë§: Imagine adding a form to your popup, collecting valuable user data, and storing it for lead generation. This integration will empower businesses to track and nurture potential leads effectively.
    
2. Analytics and reporting üìä: Gain insights into the performance of your popups with an analytics feature. Track impressions, conversion rates, and other essential metrics to optimize your engagement strategy.
    
3. Page/scroll wise popups üìê : Tailor your popups to specific pages or trigger them based on scrolling behavior. Be strategic in displaying relevant popups and engage users precisely when they need it most.
    
4. Localization üåê: Expand your reach by implementing popups with different languages using the localization feature. Connect with a global audience and deliver personalized experiences in their preferred language.

These are just a few of the exciting possibilities! However, these features will require collaborative teamwork and substantial investment.

## Final Words

This project has significant potential for growth and can effectively solve real-world problems. As an open-source initiative, it offers a valuable opportunity for collaboration and innovation in the realm of popup building. By expanding customization options, improving integration compatibility, implementing analytics capabilities, and providing robust documentation and community support, this project can become a go-to resource for businesses and developers.
